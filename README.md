# Why are we doing this?
We have been tasked with setting up a mini project - an application that links Spring backend with HTML frontend.
# How I expected the challenge to go?
Initially, a great deal of panic...although we have probably covered off these subjects in our learning, I feel the time spent on some subjects has not been enough for me to absorb, understand and then be able to apply the logic.
#What went well?
Realised I did actually know a bit more than I initially thought I did. 
#Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?
I need to understand more about the JS file aspect - linking everything together, really not sure about that part.
